          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
          <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <code>Array</code>, <code>Date</code>, and <code>Math</code>, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><i>Client-side JavaScript</i> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
            <li><i>Server-side JavaScript</i> extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
          <ul>
          <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

        <header><h2>JavaScript and the ECMAScript specification</h2></header>
        <article>
          <p>JavaScript is standardized at Ecma International — the European association for standardizing information and communication systems (ECMA was formerly an acronym for the European Computer Manufacturers Association) to deliver a standardized, international programming language based on JavaScript. This standardized version of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves the same way in all applications that support the standard. Companies can use the open standard language to develop their implementation of JavaScript. The ECMAScript standard is documented in the ECMA-262 specification. See New in JavaScript to learn more about different versions of JavaScript and ECMAScript specification editions.</p>
          <p>The ECMA-262 standard is also approved by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) as ISO-16262. You can also find the specification on the Ecma International website. The ECMAScript specification does not describe the Document Object Model (DOM), which is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and/or WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). The DOM defines the way in which HTML document objects are exposed to your script. To get a better idea about the different technologies that are used when programming with JavaScript, consult the article JavaScript technologies overview.</p>

          <h3>JavaScript documentation versus the ECMAScript specification</h3>
          <p>The ECMAScript specification is a set of requirements for implementing ECMAScript; it is useful if you want to implement standards-compliant language features in your ECMAScript implementation or engine (such as SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or V8 in Chrome).</p>
          <p>The ECMAScript document is not intended to help script programmers; use the JavaScript documentation for information on writing scripts.</p>
          <p>The ECMAScript specification uses terminology and syntax that may be unfamiliar to a JavaScript programmer. Although the description of the language may differ in ECMAScript, the language itself remains the same. JavaScript supports all functionality outlined in the ECMAScript specification.</p>
          <p>The JavaScript documentation describes aspects of the language that are appropriate for a JavaScript programmer.</p>

        <header><h2>Getting started with JavaScript</h2></header>
        <article>
          <p>Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. This guide includes some JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest versions of Firefox, so using the most recent version of Firefox is recommended.</p>
          <p>There are two tools built into Firefox that are useful for experimenting with JavaScript: the Web Console and Scratchpad.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="The_Web_Console">
          <h3>The Web Console</h3>
          <p>The Web Console shows you information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a command line that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.</p>
          <p>To open the Web Console (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Option</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd> on Mac), select "Web Console" from the "Developer" menu, which is under the "Tools" menu in Firefox. It appears at the bottom of the browser window. Along the bottom of the console is a command line that you can use to enter JavaScript.</p>
          <p>The console works the exact same way as eval: the last expression entered is returned. For the sake of simplicity, it can be imagined that every time something is entered into the console, it is actual surrounded by console.log around eval like so.</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              function greetMe(yourName) {
                alert('Hello ' + yourName);
              }
              console.log(eval('3 + 5'));
            </code>
          </pre>
        </article>
        <article id="Scratchpad">
          <h3>Scratchpad</h3>
          <p>The Web Console is great for executing single lines of JavaScript, but although you can execute multiple lines, it's not very convenient for that, and you can't save your code samples using the Web Console. So for more complex examples Scratchpad is a better tool.</p>
          <p>To open Scratchpad (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd>), select "Scratchpad" from the "Developer" menu, which is under the menu in Firefox. It opens in a separate window and is an editor that you can use to write and execute JavaScript in the browser. You can also save scripts to disk and load them from disk.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="Hello_world">
          <h3>Hello world</h3>
          <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>

            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! In the following pages, this guide will introduce you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be able to write more complex applications. But, for the time being, remember to always include the <code>(function(){"use strict";</code> before your code, and add <code>})();</code> to the end of your code. You will learn what these mean, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following —</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Massively improve performance</li>
            <li>Prevent stupid semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners</li>
            <li>Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g. having something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).</li>

          <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C and C++, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python.</p>
          <p>JavaScript is <b>case-sensitive</b> and uses the <b>Unicode</b> character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
              <span class="token keyword">var</span> Früh <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"foobar"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code>
          </pre>
          <p>But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive.</p>
          <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
          <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
          <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.</p>

        <header><h2>Comments</h2></header>

            <code class=" language-js">
              <span class="token comment">// a one line comment</span>

          <p>There are three kinds of declarations in JavaScript.</p><br>
          <dl>
            <dt><code>var</code></dt>
            <dd>Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</dd>

        </article>
        <article id="Variables">
          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
          <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
          <p>You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.</p>
          <p>Some examples of legal names are <code>Number_hits</code>, <code>temp99</code>, <code>$credit</code>, and <code>_name</code>.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="Declaring_variables">
          <h3>Declaring variables</h3>
          <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>With the keyword <code>var</code>. For example, <code>var x = 42</code>. This syntax can be used to declare both <b>local</b> and <b>global</b> variables, <i>depending on the execution context</i>.</li>
            <li>With the keyword <code>const</code> or <code>let</code>. For example, <code>let y = 13</code>. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</li>
          <ul>
          <p>You can also simply assign a value to a variable For example, <code>x = 42</code>. This form creates an undeclared global variable. It also generates a strict JavaScript warning. Undeclared global variables can often lead to unexpected behavior. Thus, it is discouraged to use undeclared global variables.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="Variable_scope">
          <h3>Variable scope</h3>
          <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
          <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log <code>5</code>, because the scope of <code>x</code> is the global context (or the function if the following codes are part of the function), not the immediate <code>if</code> statement block.</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
              <span class="token conditional_statement">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
                <span class="token keyword">var</span> x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
              <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
              <span class="token keyword">console</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>  <span class="token comment">// x is 5</span>
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>This behavior changes, when using the <code>let</code> declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-js">
              <span class="token conditional_statement">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
                <span class="token keyword">let</span> y <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
              <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
              <span class="token keyword">console</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token keyword">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>  <span class="token comment">// ReferenceError: y is not defined</span>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </article>
        <article id="Global_variables">
          <h3>Global variables</h3>
          <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the <i>global object</i>. In web pages, the global object is <code>window</code>, so you can set and access global variables using the <code>window.variable syntax</code>.</p>
          <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called <code>phoneNumber</code> is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as <code>parent.phoneNumber</code>.</p>
        </article>
        <article id="Constants">
          <h3>Constants</h3>
          <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the <code>const</code> keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign ($) and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
          <pre>
            <code class=" language-js">
              <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token constant">PI</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">3.14</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows">        
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It must be initialized to a value.</p>
          <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for <code>let</code> block-scope variables. If the <code>const</code> keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
          <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class=" language-js">
              <span class="token comment">// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR</span>

          <h3>Data types</h3>
          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Seven data types that are primitives:
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, <code>null</code> is not the same as <code>Null</code>, <code>NULL</code>, or any other variant.</li>
                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
                <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: <code>42</code> or <code>3.14159</code>.</li>
                <li>BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: <code>9007199254740992n</code>.</li>
                <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"</li>
                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. <code>Objects</code> and <code>functions</code> are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

          <h3>Data type conversion</h3>
          <p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. That means you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare it, and data types are converted automatically as needed during script execution. So, for example, you could define a variable as follows:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class=" language-js">
              <span class="token keyword">var</span> answer <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">42</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows">           
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>And later, you could assign the same variable a string value, for example:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class=" language-js">
              answer <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'Thanks for all the fish...'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows">
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>Because JavaScript is dynamically typed, this assignment does not cause an error message.</p>
          <p>In expressions involving numeric and string values with the + operator, JavaScript converts numeric values to strings. For example, consider the following statements:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class=" language-js">
              x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'The answer is '</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token number">42</span> <span class="token comment">// "The answer is 42"</span>
              y <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">42</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">' is the answer'</span> <span class="token comment">// "42 is the answer"</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows">
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>In statements involving other operators, JavaScript does not convert numeric values to strings. For example:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class=" language-js">
              <span class="token string">'37'</span> <span class="token operator">-</span> <span class="token number">7</span> <span class="token comment">// 30</span>
              <span class="token string">'37'</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token number">7</span> <span class="token comment">// "377"</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows">
